# Odin JACK Audio Examples

Real-time audio programming examples using the [JACK Audio Connection
Kit](https://jackaudio.org/) and the [Odin programming
language](https://odin-lang.org).

These are ports of the official JACK example clients, demonstrating audio
generation, MIDI processing, and audio capture.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Install JACK development libraries:**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install libjack-jackd2-dev
   
   # Fedora/RHEL
   sudo dnf install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
   ```

2. **Audio server:** You need either JACK or PipeWire running. Most modern
   Linux distributions run PipeWire by default, which provides JACK
   compatibility.

3. **Odin compiler:** Download from [odin-lang.org](https://odin-lang.org)

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build all programs
make all

# Or build individual programs
make simple_client
make midisine
make capture_client
make midiseq

# Run a program
./simple_client
```

## Available Programs

### `simple_client`
Generates a stereo sine wave output to test your audio setup.
```bash
./simple_client
```

### `midisine` 
MIDI-triggered sine wave synthesizer. Connect a MIDI controller to hear notes.
```bash
./midisine
```

### `capture_client`
Records audio from your microphone/line input to a WAV file.
```bash
./capture_client output.wav
```

### `midiseq`
A MIDI sequencer that loops a programmed sequence of notes.
```bash
# Play C4 at start, D#4 at quarter point in a half-second loop
./midiseq Sequencer 24000 0 60 8000 12000 63 8000
```

**Arguments:** `<client_name> <loop_samples> <note_on_time> <note> <note_off_time> ...`
- `loop_samples`: Loop length in samples (24000 â‰ˆ 0.5s at 48kHz)
- `note_on_time`: When to start the note (in samples)
- `note`: MIDI note number (60 = C4, 63 = D#4)
- `note_off_time`: When to stop the note (in samples)

**To hear sound:** `midiseq` outputs MIDI events, not audio. Connect it to a
synthesizer using `qjackctl` or `qpwgraph` (PipeWire only). You can use
`./midisine` as the synthesizer - just connect `midiseq:midi_out` to
`midisine:midi_in`.

Press Ctrl+C to stop (all notes will be turned off cleanly).

## Connecting Audio

After starting a program, use a JACK connection tool to route audio:

- **GUI:** `qjackctl`, `Helvum`, or `Carla`
- **Command line:** `jack_connect simple_client:output_1 system:playback_1`
